In the real world, an insurance agent:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Understands your background (income, age, family size).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Finds suitable policy options.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Explains policy benefits and premium details.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Helps you understand why a claim might get rejected.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, summarizes everything in simple words.

Your AI agent follows exactly this logical flow, using a combination of an LLM (language model), a custom decision-making framework ("agent executor"), and external tools (like database lookups for policies).
 How it works internally
1Ô∏è‚É£ User inputs a question in Streamlit UI (e.g., "Explain policy P036" or "Find best policies for me").

2Ô∏è‚É£ LLM decides which tool to use first.

It may first call a "filter policies" tool based on income, age, family size.

Then call "get policy info" tool to get more details.

Or, for claims, call "explain claim rejection" tool.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Tools are executed on the backend.

Tools are separate Python functions (like APIs) that simulate a real insurance database or logic.

4Ô∏è‚É£ LLM reads the tool outputs, keeps track of all intermediate results ("scratchpad"), and iterates if needed.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Once enough information is gathered, LLM forms a final human-friendly answer.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Streamlit UI displays the final answer along with step-by-step logs of what the model did.
